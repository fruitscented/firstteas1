Project S0 consists combination of the two ideas of an online restaurant with a social media/ blog aspect. 
People can order food and write reviews and post pictures about their experience with the location they ordered from. 
A user will open the webpage and restaurant menu choices. They can order from the restaurant and leave reviews on different items or services. 
They can leave pictures of the food or their experience. Restaurant - boba and food (like Thirstea) can filter between food and drinks.
